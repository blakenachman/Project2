        <div class="about_mark">
          "I've been a Buddhist practitioner since 1981 and have been teaching meditation and the Dharma for 20 years.  I came to Amherst College as a religious advisor in 2005. I like to present the Buddha's teaching and Buddhist practice in a non-sectarian spirit open to all who wish to develop a peaceful mind and an open heart, not just those who might consider themselves "Buddhist."  I have come to value periods of stillness and silence as an antidote to mind-created suffering and to the stressful, disconnected, and distracted way of life that we live in this country.<br><br>
          I have practiced primarily within the Theravadin Buddhist tradition with teachers from Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA, but I have spent a brief time at a monastery in Thailand (Wat Suan Moke).  In the last 10 years my teaching has been influenced as well by the Hindu teaching of Advaita and the Tibetan practice of Dzogchen within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition.  I am the founder and guiding teacher for a Buddhist organization in the Amherst area, the Bodhisara Dharma Community.  I hold a Master's degree in counseling from Seattle University and a Ph.D. in theology from Boston College, was a Visiting Professor of Religious Studies at Seattle University for seven years, and have been a lecturer on Buddhism at Smith College. I currently have a private practice of psychotherapy in downtown Amherst in addition to teaching meditation."

          <h2>Mark's Work Samples</h2>
          <br>
          <h5>Tour to Thailand</h5>
          <p>Mark led a 16-day intergenerational travel-study program for college students, faculty, staff, alumni, and others. As the Dharma Leader and Buddhist Religious Advisor at Amherst College, Mark was a knowledgeable guide. The group visited the major sites and shrines of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, indcluding the ancient ruins of Ayutthaya. There were meetings and teaching sessions with Thai Buddhists monks, nuns, and civic leaders. Additionally, there was a 3-day retreat at the International Mediation Center of Chiang Mai and a 2 day trip to the Elephant Nature Park.</p>

          <br>
          <h5>Books</h5>
          Mark has written a few books including <i>Boy Singing to Cattle</i> which was the winner of the 23rd Pearl Poetry Prize and a finalist for the 2014 Massachusetts Book Award. In the words of judge, Andrea Carter Brown, ''at once a moving elegy for a lost parent, a portrait of a way of life, and of the landscape and community tied to it, and a reconciliation with that past.'' From the wheat fields of his boyhood in the Pacific Northwest to the woods of rural New England, Hart takes us on a spiritual journey across the land, showing what it means to be a man in the brief moment of earthly existence we are afforded in life. However fleeting and impermanent the marks men have made on the land and the people around them, they remain indelible in Hart's memory, and are given lasting permanence in Boy Singing to Cattle, his first book of poetry.</p>
